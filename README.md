## Description: This JavaScript program processes course, assignment, and learner submission data to calculate each learnerâ€™s assignment scores and overall average. It accounts for late submissions with a 10% penalty and ignores assignments with due dates in the future.


## Reflection (Optional)
## What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
## I would've wrote down what is needed and how to get it in words instead of coding. Also the wording of the assignment was really hard for me to gasp. 

## Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
## Anything with arrays 

## What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
## I wanted add a switch statement. 

## Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when.

## practice arrays more.
